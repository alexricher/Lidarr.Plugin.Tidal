# Tagging Implementation Overview

This document serves as the main reference guide to the audio tagging implementation for the Lidarr.Plugin.Tidal project. It provides an overview of all tagging-related documentation and explains how each document contributes to the overall implementation.

## Documentation Structure

The tagging implementation is documented across several specialized files, each focusing on a specific aspect of the project:

| Document | Purpose | Primary Audience |
|----------|---------|-----------------|
| [Tagging Project Organization](./TAGGING_PROJECT_ORGANIZATION.md) | Code structure and organization | Developers |
| [Tagging Proof of Concept](./TAGGING_PROOF_OF_CONCEPT.md) | Initial implementation approach | Developers |
| [Tagging Integration Guide](./TAGGING_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md) | Integration with Lidarr and Tidal | Developers |
| [Tagging Implementation Milestone Plan](./TAGGING_IMPLEMENTATION_MILESTONE_PLAN.md) | Timeline and tasks | Project Managers, Developers |
| [Tagging Settings Integration](./TAGGING_SETTINGS_INTEGRATION.md) | UI settings implementation | Developers |
| [Tagging Testing Strategy](./TAGGING_TESTING_STRATEGY.md) | Testing approach | QA Engineers, Developers |

## Implementation Workflow

For developers implementing the tagging functionality, we recommend following this workflow:

1. **Understand the Structure**: Review the Project Organization document to understand how code should be organized.

2. **Validate Core Concepts**: Implement the Proof of Concept to validate the fundamental technical approach.

3. **Plan Integration**: Consult the Integration Guide to understand how the tagging system will connect to other components.

4. **Implement Settings**: Follow the Settings Integration guide to add user-configurable options.

5. **Build Test Framework**: Set up testing based on the Testing Strategy document.

6. **Track Progress**: Use the Milestone Plan to track progress and prioritize work.

## Key Interfaces and Components

The tagging implementation centers around these core interfaces and components:

```
ITaggingService - Primary service for applying tags to audio files
├── ITrackMatcher - Matches audio files to track metadata
├── ITagProcessor - Reads and writes tags to audio files
├── IMetadataProvider - Provides metadata for tagging
└── ITagEnricher - Enhances tags with additional metadata
```

## Next Steps

1. Review the Project Organization document to understand the overall structure
2. Implement the Proof of Concept to validate the approach
3. Begin developing according to the Milestone Plan
4. Set up the testing framework as outlined in the Testing Strategy
