## System Overview

The Lidarr Tidal Plugin extends Lidarr's functionality by enabling direct integration with Tidal's music streaming service. The plugin allows Lidarr to search, discover, and download music from Tidal, then process and import it into the Lidarr library.

### Key Capabilities
- Authenticate with Tidal API
- Search for artists, albums, and tracks
- Download music in various quality formats
- Process metadata and artwork
- Import into Lidarr library
- Monitor download progress
- Manage rate limiting and API constraints

## Component Architecture

The plugin follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Core Components

#### 1. API Integration Layer
- **TidalApiClient**: Primary interface to Tidal API
- **AuthenticationManager**: Handles login, token refresh, and session management
- **ApiRateLimiter**: Enforces API usage constraints
- **RequestBuilder**: Constructs properly formatted API requests

#### 2. Download Management
- **DownloadTaskQueue**: Orchestrates download operations
- **DownloadItem**: Represents a single download task
- **ProgressTracker**: Monitors and reports download progress
- **ConcurrencyManager**: Controls parallel download operations

#### 3. Processing Pipeline
- **AudioProcessor**: Handles format conversion and optimization
- **MetadataProcessor**: Extracts and embeds metadata
- **ArtworkProcessor**: Handles artwork retrieval and embedding
- **QualityAnalyzer**: Verifies audio quality specifications

#### 4. Integration Layer
- **LidarrImporter**: Handles import into Lidarr library
- **EventBridge**: Connects plugin events to Lidarr event system
- **ConfigurationManager**: Manages plugin settings
- **StatusReporter**: Reports plugin status to Lidarr

## Data Flow

The plugin processes data through several stages:

1. **Search & Discovery**
   - User initiates search in Lidarr UI
   - Plugin queries Tidal API for matching content
   - Results are transformed to Lidarr format and displayed

2. **Download Initiation**
   - User selects content for download
   - Download request is validated and prioritized
   - Task is added to DownloadTaskQueue

3. **Download Execution**
   - DownloadTaskQueue processes tasks based on priority and rate limits
   - Content is downloaded in chunks with progress tracking
   - Temporary files are created in configured download location

4. **Processing**
   - Downloaded content is verified for integrity
   - Audio is processed according to quality settings
   - Metadata and artwork are embedded
   - Files are organized according to naming conventions

5. **Import**
   - Processed files are imported into Lidarr library
   - Lidarr database is updated with new content
   - Temporary files are cleaned up
   - Download status is updated

## Integration Points

The plugin integrates with several systems:

### Lidarr Core
- **Plugin API**: Connects to Lidarr's plugin infrastructure
- **Event System**: Publishes and subscribes to Lidarr events
- **Configuration**: Uses Lidarr's configuration system
- **UI Integration**: Extends Lidarr UI with custom components

### Tidal API
- **Authentication**: OAuth-based authentication flow
- **Content API**: Search and metadata retrieval
- **Streaming API**: Content download endpoints
- **User API**: Account information and preferences

### File System
- **Download Directory**: Temporary storage for downloads
- **Media Library**: Final destination for processed content
- **Configuration Storage**: Persistent storage for settings
- **Cache Directory**: Storage for temporary processing artifacts
