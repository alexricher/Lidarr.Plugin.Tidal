# Refactoring Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the refactoring work done to improve the codebase by reducing duplication, enhancing error handling, and improving logging.

## 1. Circuit Breaker Pattern Generalization

### Initial State
- `TidalCircuitBreaker` implemented the circuit breaker pattern specifically for Tidal
- The implementation was tightly coupled to Tidal-specific code
- No reuse across other parts of the application

### Solution
- Created a generic `ICircuitBreaker` interface in `Lidarr.Plugin.Tidal.Services.CircuitBreaker`
- Implemented a generic `CircuitBreaker` class that can be used for any service
- Created a `CircuitBreakerSettings` class for configuring circuit breakers
- Created a `CircuitBreakerFactory` for easily creating circuit breakers with different settings
- Created a `TidalCircuitBreakerAdapter` to adapt the generic circuit breaker to the Tidal-specific interface

### Benefits
- Reusable circuit breaker pattern that can be applied to any service
- Consistent circuit breaker behavior across the application
- More configurable with settings for different scenarios
- Better error handling and logging

## 2. Enhanced Logging with Emojis

### Initial State
- Logging was functional but lacked visual cues
- Difficult to quickly scan logs for important information
- Inconsistent logging patterns across the codebase

### Solution
- Created a `LoggingExtensions` class with methods for logging with emojis
- Created a `LogEmojis` class with constants for common emojis used in logging
- Added emoji support to make logs more readable and visually appealing

### Benefits
- More readable logs with visual cues
- Easier to scan logs for important information
- Consistent logging patterns across the application
- Improved developer experience

## 3. Unified Retry Logic

### Initial State
- Retry logic was implemented in multiple places with different approaches
- Inconsistent error handling and retry behavior
- Duplication of code

### Solution
- Created a `RetryPolicy` class for retrying operations with exponential backoff
- Created a `RetryPolicyFactory` for easily creating retry policies with different settings
- Implemented a `RetryableHttpClient` as an example of using the retry policy

### Benefits
- Consistent retry behavior across the application
- Exponential backoff with jitter to prevent thundering herd problems
- Better error handling and logging
- Reduced code duplication

## 4. Token Bucket Rate Limiting Consolidation

### Initial State
- Multiple implementations of the token bucket algorithm:
  - `TokenBucketUtil.cs` - A static utility class with helper methods
  - `RateLimiter.cs` - Had its own token bucket implementation for API rate limiting
  - `DownloadTaskQueue.cs` - Had its own token bucket implementation for download rate limiting

### Solution
- Transformed the existing `TokenBucketUtil` static utility class into a proper `TokenBucketRateLimiter` class
- Maintained backward compatibility by keeping the static utility methods
- Added a clean interface for rate limiting with `ITokenBucketRateLimiter`
- Updated consumers to use the new implementation

### Benefits
- Eliminated duplication of token bucket implementations
- Consistent rate limiting behavior across the application
- Better resource management with proper disposal
- Improved error handling and logging

## Conclusion

These refactoring efforts have significantly improved the codebase by:

1. **Reducing Duplication**: Consolidated duplicate implementations into reusable components
2. **Enhancing Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error handling with proper logging
3. **Improving Logging**: Added emoji support for more readable logs
4. **Standardizing Patterns**: Implemented consistent patterns for circuit breaking, retrying, and rate limiting

The code is now more maintainable, easier to understand, and more robust in handling error conditions.
