## üöÄ Installation

This plugin requires your Lidarr setup to be using the `plugins` branch. 

### Docker Setup

```yml
lidarr:
  image: ghcr.io/hotio/lidarr:pr-plugins
  container_name: lidarr
  environment:
    - PUID:100
    - PGID:1001
    - TZ:Etc/UTC
  volumes:
    - /path/to/config/:/config
    - /path/to/downloads/:/downloads
    - /path/to/music:/music
  ports:
    - 8686:8686
  restart: unless-stopped
```

### With FFMPEG Support

To enable audio conversion features, include FFMPEG in your container:

```yml
lidarr:
  build:
    context: /path/to/directory/containing/dockerfile
    dockerfile: Dockerfile
  container_name: lidarr
  environment:
    - PUID:1000
    - PGID:1001
    - TZ:Etc/UTC
  volumes:
    - /path/to/config/:/config
    - /path/to/downloads/:/data/downloads
    - /path/to/tidal/config/:/data/tidal-config
    - /path/to/music:/data/music
  ports:
    - 8686:8686
  restart: unless-stopped
```

```Dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/hotio/lidarr:pr-plugins

RUN apk add --no-cache ffmpeg
```

### Plugin Installation Steps

1. In Lidarr, go to `System -> Plugins`, paste `https://github.com/alexricher/Lidarr.Plugin.Tidal` into the GitHub URL box, and press Install.
2. Go into the Indexer settings and press Add. In the modal, choose `Tidal` (under Other at the bottom).
3. Enter a path to use to store user data, press Test, it will error, press Cancel.
4. Refresh the page, then re-open the Add screen and choose Tidal again.
5. There should now be a `Tidal URL` setting with a URL in it. Open that URL in a new tab.
6. In the new tab, log in to Tidal, then press `Yes, continue`. It will then bring you to a page labeled "Oops." Copy the new URL for that tab (something like `https://tidal.com/android/login/auth?code=[VERY LONG CODE]`).
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Do NOT share this URL with people as it grants people access to your account.
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Redirect URLs are NOT reusable. If you need to sign in again, make sure to use a new Tidal URL from the settings, they are regenerated semi-often.
7. Enter a path to use to store user data and paste the copied Tidal URL into the `Redirect Url` option. Then press Save.
8. Go into the Download Client settings and press Add. In the modal, choose `Tidal` (under Other at the bottom).
9. Put the path you want to download tracks to and fill out the other settings to your choosing.
   - If you want `.lrc` files to be saved, go into the Media Management settings and enable Import Extra Files and add `lrc` to the list.
   - Make sure to only enable the FFMPEG settings if you are sure that FFMPEG is available to Lidarr, it may cause issues otherwise.
10. Go into the Profile settings and find the Delay Profiles. On each (by default there is only one), click the wrench on the right and toggle Tidal on.
11. Optional: To prevent Lidarr from downloading all track files into the base artist folder rather than into their own separate album folder, go into the Media Management settings and enable Rename Tracks. You can change the formats to your liking, but it helps to let each album have their own folder.

## üìä Download Status Tracking

The plugin includes basic download status tracking functionality that saves detailed information about your downloads. This data can be used to:

- Monitor download progress and completion
- Track statistics about your music collection
- Identify potential issues or bottlenecks
- Analyze download patterns and performance

### Status File Generation

To enable status file generation:

1. In Lidarr, go to `Settings -> Download Clients`
2. Edit your Tidal download client
3. Set a valid `Status Files Path` (e.g., `/config/tidal-status` in Docker or a local path)
4. Save your settings

The plugin will generate detailed status JSON files in this location that can be used for monitoring and analysis.

### Coming Soon: TidalDownloadViewer

A web-based interface for visualizing and managing your Tidal downloads is currently in development. This tool will provide:

- üìà Real-time download statistics and analytics
- üìä Artist and album-based insights
- ‚è±Ô∏è Session monitoring and management
- üö® Error detection and diagnostics
- üîÑ Automatic updates and notifications
- üì± Mobile-friendly interface

Stay tuned for the release of TidalDownloadViewer in an upcoming version!

## üè† Container-Friendly Architecture

Our plugin implements a sophisticated error-tolerant architecture optimized for containerized environments:

- üìÅ **Hierarchical Path Resolution**: When accessing storage locations, the system tries paths in this order:
  1. User-configured paths in settings
  2. Home directory path (~/.lidarr/TidalPlugin)
  3. AppData directory (ApplicationData/Lidarr/TidalPlugin)
  4. System temporary directory (fallback of last resort)
  
- üõ°Ô∏è **Lazy Component Initialization**: Components are initialized only when needed:
  - Download status manager initializes on first status operation
  - TidalProxy starts with default settings, then updates when real settings available
  - Download task queue buffers tasks until proper initialization

- ‚öôÔ∏è **Fail-Safe Configuration**: Protections against configuration issues:
  - Null settings handled gracefully throughout the codebase
  - Container permission issues detected and worked around
  - Test writes performed before committing to paths
  - Status files persist across container restarts

- üìä **Status Preservation**: Download status information is maintained across sessions:
  - Status files written periodically to the most accessible location
  - Statistics tracked even during error conditions
  - Multiple fallback mechanisms for status storage

- üîÑ **Recovery Mechanisms**: The system includes various recovery strategies:
  - Automatic retry for throttled downloads
  - Exponential backoff when rate limiting detected
  - Automatic session rotation to avoid detection
  - Safe re-initialization after errors

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Building the Plugin

This repository includes a PowerShell script to help with building and managing the plugin.

To build the plugin locally:

```powershell
.\build.ps1
```

The build script supports several parameters:

```powershell
.\build.ps1 -BaseVersion "10.1.0" -Verbose                # Build with custom version
.\build.ps1 -CopyToLocalPath:$false -Verbose              # Build without copying to local path
.\build.ps1 -CreateZip:$false -Verbose                    # Build without creating zip file
.\build.ps1 -CleanPreviousBuilds:$false -Verbose          # Build without cleaning previous builds
```

### Creating Releases

This repository uses GitHub Actions to automate the release process. There are two workflows:

1. **build.yml**: Runs on every push to the main branch and pull requests to build and test the plugin
2. **release.yml**: Runs when a tag starting with 'v' is pushed to create a release

To create a new release:

1. Use the `create_release.ps1` script to create and push a new tag:

```powershell
.\create_release.ps1 -Version "10.0.2"
```

2. The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically:
   - Build the plugin with the specified version
   - Create a release with the plugin zip file
   - Generate release notes based on commits since the last tag

You can also use the `lidarr_plugin_manager.ps1` script for more advanced release management:

```powershell
.\scripts\lidarr_plugin_manager.ps1 -CreateGitHubRelease -PluginVersion "10.0.2"
```

### Architecture

The plugin's architecture consists of several key components working together:

1. **Tidal Indexer**: Implements Lidarr's indexer interface to search for music on Tidal
   - Handles OAuth authentication with Tidal
   - Provides search results with quality information
   - Integrates with Lidarr's release management system

2. **Tidal Download Client**: Implements Lidarr's download client interface 
   - Manages the download queue with the TidalProxy
   - Initializes the status manager with proper error handling
   - Uses lazy initialization to avoid startup errors
   - Implements natural behavior simulation via UserBehaviorSimulator

3. **Download Status Manager**: Tracks and persists download progress
   - Manages status files with multi-level path fallbacks
   - Provides detailed statistics on download activity
   - Includes robust error handling for file access issues
   - Automatically recovers from permission problems

4. **TidalProxy**: Handles core API interactions with Tidal
   - Manages authentication and requests
   - Initializes with default settings to avoid null references
   - Delegates downloads to the DownloadTaskQueue

5. **Download Task Queue**: Manages download operations
   - Implements the natural download order logic
   - Handles throttling detection and backoff
   - Processes downloads according to behavior profiles
   - Manages parallel download operations

6. **User Behavior Simulator**: Sophisticated behavior modeling
   - Implements realistic timing for download operations
   - Models human-like music consumption patterns
   - Adapts behavior based on time and context
   - Provides anti-detection measures through varied patterns

These components communicate through well-defined interfaces with proper error handling between boundaries, ensuring that failures in one component don't cascade to others.

## üêõ Known Issues & Workarounds

- **Search results size estimates**: Search results provide an estimated file size instead of an actual one
- **Token storage location**: User access tokens are stored in a separate folder even though Lidarr has a system to store it available to plugins
- **Hi-Res FLAC identification**: Some Hi-Res FLAC files may not be properly identified
- **Docker permission issues**: If experiencing permission problems in Docker, try:
  - Setting proper PUID/PGID values matching your host user
  - Ensuring volume mounts have appropriate permissions
  - Specifying a writable path in the Status Files Path setting
  - Letting the plugin use fallback mechanisms by not setting paths at all
- **Rate limiting**: If Tidal begins to rate-limit your account:
  - Enable throttling detection to automatically handle this
  - Increase download delays between tracks
  - Reduce parallel download count
  - Enable natural behavior simulation with longer breaks
- **API Error: Sequence contains more than one matching element**: If you encounter this error when saving settings:
  - Restart Lidarr completely
  - If problem persists, try removing the plugin and reinstalling it
  - This indicates a duplicate class registration issue

## üìú Versioning

This plugin uses a date-based versioning approach:

1. The base version is defined in `src/Directory.Build.props`:
   ```xml
   <PropertyGroup>
     <FileVersion>10.0.1</FileVersion>
     <AssemblyVersion>10.0.1</AssemblyVersion>
     <Version>10.0.1</Version>
   </PropertyGroup>
   ```

2. During the build process (both local and CI), a date-based build number is appended to this base version:
   - The build number format is `yyMMdd` (year, month, day)
   - Example: `230516` for May 16, 2023

3. The final version format is: `{BaseVersion}.{BuildNumber}`
   - Example: `10.0.1.230516` (build on May 16, 2023)

This approach ensures that:
- Each build has a unique, chronologically sortable version number
- The version number is predictable and human-readable
- The build process doesn't require modifying source files

## üîÆ Future Improvements
