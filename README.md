```

Configure Lidarr to focus on your preferred genres, and this configuration will create a highly believable pattern of a genre enthusiast.

## 📊 Download Status Tracking

The plugin includes basic download status tracking functionality that saves detailed information about your downloads. This data can be used to:

- Monitor download progress and completion
- Track statistics about your music collection
- Identify potential issues or bottlenecks
- Analyze download patterns and performance

### Status File Generation

To enable status file generation:

1. In Lidarr, go to `Settings -> Download Clients`
2. Edit your Tidal download client
3. Set a valid `Status Files Path` (e.g., `/config/tidal-status` in Docker or a local path)
4. Save your settings

The plugin will generate detailed status JSON files in this location that can be used for monitoring and analysis.

### Coming Soon: TidalDownloadViewer

A web-based interface for visualizing and managing your Tidal downloads is currently in development. This tool will provide:

- 📈 Real-time download statistics and analytics
- 📊 Artist and album-based insights
- ⏱️ Session monitoring and management
- 🚨 Error detection and diagnostics
- 🔄 Automatic updates and notifications
- 📱 Mobile-friendly interface

Stay tuned for the release of TidalDownloadViewer in an upcoming version!

## 🏠 Container-Friendly Architecture

Our plugin implements an error-handling architecture optimized for containerized environments:

- **Path Resolution**: Automatically detects and adapts to container environments
- **Permission Handling**: Gracefully handles permission issues with fallback mechanisms
- **Error Recovery**: Implements robust error handling for network and I/O operations
- **Diagnostic Logging**: Detailed logging to help troubleshoot container-specific issues

## 🛠️ Development

### Building the Plugin

To build the plugin locally, use the build script in the repository:

```powershell
.\build.ps1
```

The build script supports several parameters:

```powershell
.\build.ps1 -PluginVersion "10.0.2" -Verbose                # Build with custom version
.\build.ps1 -CopyToLidarr $false -Verbose                   # Build without copying to Lidarr
.\build.ps1 -CreateZip $true -Verbose                       # Create zip file
.\build.ps1 -Clean $true -Verbose                           # Clean previous builds
```

### Creating Releases

This repository uses GitHub Actions to automate the release process. There are two workflows:

1. **build.yml**: Runs on every push to the main branch and pull requests to build and test the plugin
2. **release.yml**: Runs when a tag starting with 'v' is pushed to create a release

To create a new release:

1. Create and push a new tag with the version number:

```powershell
git tag v10.0.2
git push origin v10.0.2
```

2. The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically:
   - Build the plugin with the specified version
   - Create a release with the plugin zip file
   - Generate release notes based on commits since the last tag

You can also use the `lidarr_plugin_manager.ps1` script for more advanced release management:

```powershell
.\scripts\lidarr_plugin_manager.ps1 -CreateGitHubRelease -PluginVersion "10.0.2"
```

### Architecture

The plugin's architecture consists of several key components working together:

1. **Tidal Indexer**: Implements Lidarr's indexer interface to search for music on Tidal
   - Handles OAuth authentication with Tidal
   - Provides search results with quality information
   - Integrates with Lidarr's release management system

2. **Tidal Download Client**: Implements Lidarr's download client interface 
   - Manages the download queue with the TidalProxy
   - Initializes the status manager with proper error handling
   - Uses lazy initialization to avoid startup errors
   - Implements natural behavior simulation via UserBehaviorSimulator

3. **Download Status Manager**: Tracks and persists download progress
   - Manages status files with multi-level path fallbacks
   - Provides detailed statistics on download activity
   - Includes robust error handling for file access issues
   - Automatically recovers from permission problems

4. **TidalProxy**: Handles core API interactions with Tidal
   - Manages authentication and requests
   - Initializes with default settings to avoid null references
   - Delegates downloads to the DownloadTaskQueue

5. **Download Task Queue**: Manages download operations
   - Implements the natural download order logic
   - Handles throttling detection and backoff
   - Processes downloads according to behavior profiles
   - Manages parallel download operations

6. **User Behavior Simulator**: Sophisticated behavior modeling
   - Implements realistic timing for download operations
   - Models human-like music consumption patterns
   - Adapts behavior based on time and context
   - Provides anti-detection measures through varied patterns

These components communicate through well-defined interfaces with proper error handling between boundaries, ensuring that failures in one component don't cascade to others.

## 🐛 Known Issues & Workarounds

- **Search results size estimates**: Search results provide an estimated file size instead of an actual one
- **Token storage location**: User access tokens are stored in a separate folder even though Lidarr has a system to store it available to plugins
- **Hi-Res FLAC identification**: Some Hi-Res FLAC files may not be properly identified
- **Docker permission issues**: If experiencing permission problems in Docker, try:
  - Setting proper PUID/PGID values matching your host user
  - Ensuring volume mounts have appropriate permissions
  - Specifying a writable path in the Status Files Path setting
  - Letting the plugin use fallback mechanisms by not setting paths at all
- **Rate limiting**: If Tidal begins to rate-limit your account:
  - Enable throttling detection to automatically handle this
  - Increase download delays between tracks
  - Reduce parallel download count
  - Enable natural behavior simulation with longer breaks
- **API Error: Sequence contains more than one matching element**: If you encounter this error when saving settings:
  - Restart Lidarr completely
  - If problem persists, try removing the plugin and reinstalling it
  - This indicates a duplicate class registration issue

## 📜 Versioning

This plugin uses an incremental build number versioning approach:

1. The base version is defined in the GitHub workflow file (`.github/workflows/build.yml`):
   ```yaml
   env:
     MAJOR_VERSION: 10
     MINOR_VERSION: 0
     PATCH_VERSION: 2
   ```

2. During the build process, an incremental build number is appended to this base version:
   - The build number is stored in `.github/workflows/.build_number`
   - It's incremented by 1 with each successful build on the main branch

3. The final version format is: `{MAJOR_VERSION}.{MINOR_VERSION}.{PATCH_VERSION}.{BUILD_NUMBER}`
   - Example: `10.0.2.42` (build #42)

For tagged releases, the version is taken directly from the tag (e.g., `v10.0.2` becomes version `10.0.2`).

This approach ensures that:
- Each build has a unique, chronologically sortable version number
- The version number is predictable and human-readable
- The build process doesn't require modifying source files

## 🔮 Future Improvements

Here are some planned improvements for future versions:

1. **Reliability Enhancements**:
   - Further improvements to error handling in containerized environments
   - Transaction-based status files to prevent corruption
